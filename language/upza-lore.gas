        from = "With the arrival of the legions, a new chapter of the Utraean Peninsula began. Soldiers of 2nd and 10th legions arrived here in order to create a state similar to the kingdom of Ehb with its monarchy and capital in the castle of Hiroth. The kingdom consisted of eight constituencies:\n- Hiroth in the south-west, where the greatest Utraean ruins had been found, soon became the designated place for the seat of government, and an imposing castle was built on a defensible cliffside.\n- Elddim, in the northern center, was the principality of Lord Hovart.\n- Fallraen was established to control the snowy mountains of the southern center.\n- Meren, at the only navigable shore of the peninsula, was founded as a port in high hopes of international trade and traffic; it serves currently as a seaside resort.\n- Legion Dwarves settled again in the abandoned mines of Crystwind.\n- The Droog of Quillrabe were not keen on joining the new kingdom, and to this day the official wording is 'sovereign in free association' and what exactly that means is anyone's guess.\n- The Goblins were even less keen on joining the kingdom, and after a short war the outpost of Lang was established to ensure the rules of the non-aggression pact.\n- Lastly, Grescal, a small oasis at the edge of the Endless Dunes, became its own constituency, simply because it was too far away to be practically governed by any other place.\n\nKarlin Iliarth, a popular commander of the 2nd Legion and renowned explorer of the river named after him (and cousin of Lord Hovart), was crowned as the first king of Hiroth. He ascended the throne as a young man and ruled the kingdom wisely to his old age. Both his sons fell victim to attacks. Many suspect they were assassinated by Lord Hovart who hoped to ascend the throne if King Karlin had no direct heir, but nothing could ever be proven. But when King Karlin was dying, and the Legion understood that a King Hovart would not be popular, they decided to hold a referendum to allow for female heirs to the throne, which the subjects overwhelmingly voted in favor for. And so came to pass that Anne Iliarth, granddaughter of King Karlin, was crowned as Queen of Hiroth. Like her grandfather, she was bound to the kingdom by the priesthood's most powerful spells, some of ancient Utraean origin, which ensured the kingdom's prosperity under her reign.\n\nI, historian Lily Prieve, was born after Her Majesty's coronation, and have seen the kingdom flourish in my youth. Now the Queen is dead, and the lands have fallen into ruin. Krug are ravaging the country, beasts and monsters roam the wildernesses, bandits rule the Cloud Forest and witches lurk in the Lang Mire. I fear for the future of this land; I pray the priesthood will be successful in their attempts to resurrect the Queen, and by the powers of the coronation spells the kingdom will thrive again.";

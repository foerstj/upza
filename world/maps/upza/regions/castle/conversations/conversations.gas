As you may know, the fates of monarch and kingdom of Hiroth are bound together, by the power of mystic spells cast at the coronation.

This is why, when I died, the kingdom fell into ruin; and now that I'm back, the kingdom too will prosper again. It may be devastated now, but by time it will be rebuilt and repopulated. We shall set forth to settle the Peninsula anew, Man and Droog, Goblin and Dwarf. We shall invite pioneers, Legionnaires, Travelers. And with me as its queen, and the legion as its protector, the kingdom will rise to new heights. Glory to Hiroth!";

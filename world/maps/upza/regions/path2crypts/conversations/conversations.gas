If you don't feel up to it, you can always head back to Elddim through Iliarth Valley. However, most travellers out this way are interested in the Ancient Crypt just to the southeast across the bridge.";

We don't use it much these days, but I just checked it a few days ago and it seems to be working as well as can be expected. If you're missing town life, just touch the statuette and you'll be whisked back to Elddim in a blink of an eye. You'll find it up on the plateau southeast across the bridge here.";

Ferdl took me with him to Hiroth.
In their hurry, something must have gone terribly wrong. Maybe it was some ancient Utraean magic interfering with their own; the Utraeans were known to meddle in otherworldly realms. When Kavaren had cast the final spell, there was a flash of pale green light, and Death himself stood right before us! As we stood petrified, he devoured the queen's corpse, then turned to us. He killed Kavaren with a single blow of his scythe. We all ran for our lives, but the priests had already been poisoned - I had been standing a bit further away. Ferdl fell to the undead when he arrived back in Quillrabe. We threw him down from the southern walls; and in a regrettable frenzy, my Droog brothers threw down the other Humans as well.

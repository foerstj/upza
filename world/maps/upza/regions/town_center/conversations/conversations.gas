If you can get past the undead, you'll find yourself emerging back outside in Hovart Marsh. It's a bit of a trek to Hovart's Folly, but the scenery is worth the journey. Once you clear your way through the Folly, it's a quick walk south through Elddim Glade to the Crystwind Mines. And the mines exit right into the town of Crystwind itself.";

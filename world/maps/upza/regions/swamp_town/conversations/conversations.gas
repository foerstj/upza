You'll be wanting to head south along the boardwalk and then west after the Guard Tower on Grod's Island until you see the entrance to the Goblin Warrens ahead. We do a fair bit of trading with the little green folk, so they might be inclined to let you pass through their tunnels to Redwood Gap. Once in the forest, stay to the south and west. Cross the bridge over the gulch and continue along the forest path until you come to the Fury's Den. If you can avoid the Furies, you should make it out to Iliarth Canyon. Make your way down to the river's side and follow it through Iliarth Falls. There is a footpath down the cliff face to the Canyon floor, narrow though it may be. Stay close to the river through Quillrabe Canyons and eventually you'll come to Quillrabe itself. Might want to pack a fair bit of provisions, as it's a long trip through hostile territory.";

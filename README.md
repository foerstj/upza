# Utraean Peninsula: Zombie Apocalypse

A map for Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna, based on the original multi-player campaign.

*It has been a decade since the Utraean Peninsula was ravished by a zombie apocalypse. The courageous 2nd Legion once more tries to set foot there, and with ships and supplies provided by Ehb, they sail westward. They attempt to land on the coast of Meren, and only narrowly escape the attacking Undead, getting stranded on the Eastern Island - a mythical place said to have magical passages to the Peninsula...*

## Installation

Put the dsmap file into the DSLOA folder of your Dungeon Siege installation.\
This map requires Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna.

## Compatibility

No known compatibility issues.

## What I did

This map is based on the *Utraean Peninsula remastered* project at https://github.com/foerstj/up-remaster, containing changes of the *revisit* and *single-player* branches, including the Fury Eye but without any mules or companions.

Changes from there on:
- Map renamed, obviously
- Set up the Eastern Island as the initial starting location, with Loola there

## How to build

GasPy repo: https://github.com/foerstj/gaspy

- Put TankCreator and gaspy on the same folder level as your Dungeon Siege installation. Basically in the upper folder, you should have a "Dungeon Siege" folder, a "TankCreator" folder, and a "gaspy" folder.
- Put this repo as "Bits" into your personal Dungeon Siege LoA folder (where the savegames & screenshots are).
- Go into your Dungeon Siege installation folder and open CMD there.
- %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Dungeon Siege LoA\Bits\build.bat
